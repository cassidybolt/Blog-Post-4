Although these projects have become increasingly challenging, this has actually been one of my favorite pieces to create. While at first it was difficult to understand the code behind creating a star, once I understood how each variable impacted the shape, I had a lot of fun experimenting with different variations. My past projects were relatively uniform; I liked having a particular pattern or color scheme. However, with this piece, I kept it entirely grey scale and left the star imagery up to chance. In the end, it created just the aesthetic I was envisioning. 

With the stars appearing sporadically, the piece reflects the underlying message I was trying to convey, which is the confusion that characterizes the current “State of Our Union” (what I ultimately decided to title this piece). This is not to be a pessimistic or anarchistic visual, but rather one that compels the viewer to ask, What is going on today? What does it mean to be an American at present? The stars in particular strive to symbolize the disarray, as their seven points serve as a connection to the infamous seven deadly sins. How ethical, honest, and/or sinful are America’s leaders today? Similarly, the slow-paced speed with which they ominously move across the screen intends to emulate a robotic following akin to a soldier’s march. In a way, watching them glide across the screen is almost trance-like. Ultimately, I hope that my piece compels my audience to think critically about the state of our union, to inhibit blind following and constantly ask questions.
